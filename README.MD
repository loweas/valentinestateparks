# Mapbox Valentine Colors

This map is to pratice map styling in mapbox. The coloring style is to reflect the recent holiday, Valentine's Day. Published Page : https://loweas.github.io/valentinestateparks/

## Icon Description
I added layer's within mapbox of Oregon State Parks. The icon's represent unique or important features to each park. This data was collected from [OregonExplore][]

# Hiking icon
Given the limited icons in mapbox, I created a hiking icon by using Inkscape. I also changed the individual colors of the svg files to different colors of the rainbow to recognize *Love is Love!*

## Hashtags
When you zoom in to 8, the parks unique hashtag used on Instagram is revealed.
