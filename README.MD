# Mapbox Valentine Colors

This map is to pratice map styling in [mapbox][]. The coloring style is to reflect the recent holiday, Valentine's Day. Published Page : https://loweas.github.io/valentinestateparks/

## Icon Description
I added layer's within mapbox of Oregon State Parks. The icon's represent unique or important features to each park. This data was collected from [OregonExplore][]

The amenities data was collected individually (time consuming) from the [Oregonstateparks.org][] website. The amenities have a top down ordering, which can be argued of what level of importance each amentity is. For this lay out the order was decided as:

1. Camping <img src="/assets/icons/campsite-15.svg">
2. Beach Access <img src="/assets/icons/beach-15.svg">
3. Biking <img src="/assets/icons/bicycle-share-15.svg">
4. Waterfalls <img src="/assets/icons/waterfall-15.svg">
5. Swimming <img src="/assets/icons/swimming-15.svg">
6. Fishing <img src="/assets/icons/aquarium-15.svg">
7. Hiking Trails <img src="/assets/image/hiking.svg">
8. Picnic <img src="/assets/icons/picnic-site-15.svg">
9. Horse Riding Trails  <img src="/assets/icons/horse-riding-15.svg">
10. Viewpoints <img src="/assets/icons/attraction-15.svg">
11. Playground <img src="/assets/icons/playground-15.svg">
12. Parks <img src="/assets/icons/park-15.svg">

## Hiking icon
Given the limited icons in mapbox, I created a hiking icon by using [Inkscape][]. <img src="/assets/image/hiking.svg">

I also changed the individual colors of the svg files to different colors of the rainbow to recognize *Love is Love!*
